### AgileReport 1 Week02
- Current State: added creature movement 
- Goals: add animation
- Blockers: timing. I plan to use a random number genertor for a lot of the functions, and i dont want actions to get overwritten. 
      ex; the walk movement is on a timer, but for it to sit for a cetain amount of time before it moves again
- Next steps: click and drag objects around
