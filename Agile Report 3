### Retrospective
1. What went well?
I finished the animation. I also created a drag script, which can be applied to any object.
2. What didn’t go well?
I have to fix the origin of the creature sprite. Right now its drag point is where you clicked. And I want it to be separate for the creature and objects
3. What can I improve next week?
Fixing the drag point and I’m feeling like remaking the sprites to a mix non pixels and pixels for the border

### Current state
Creature can move. Player can drag objects and creature. Transparency and animation working. Have not tested it in build!!

### User story 
As a user I want interactivity so I won’t get bored of just watching the Pal

### Acceptance criteria 
Creature will leave dirt marks on your screen which will block your screen
You will have to click and clean up the mess so that you can see again
This will force you to pay attention to the Pal

### Definition of done
Randomly spawn in dirt objects. When player clicks on it, destroy object.
